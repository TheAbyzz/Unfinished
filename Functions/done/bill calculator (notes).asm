x86-64 assembly from scratch (what are the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror)

check the 16 byte stack aligment requirment, it's needed for some instrunctions
is push rbp mov rbp, rsp always required
https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/
stack frame
in 64 bit intel assembly language progamming for linux.pdf page 108
push rbp mov rbp, rsp can be omitted
WE SUBTRCT OR PUSH BEFORE CALL AND ADD OR POP AFTER CALL
push or sub is not needed for printf
it's only needed with floating point instructions

section .data
	msg: db "Hello world!",0
	fmt: db "%lf",0x0a,0
	float1: dq 1.5         ; could we align the memory here to avoid the 16 byte alignment in main?

section .text
	global main
	extern printf

main: push  rbp
      mov   rbp, rsp
      lea   rdi, [fmt]
      movsd xmm0, [float1] ; movq xxm0, qword [float1], movsd (64), movss (32)
      mov   rax, 1
      call  printf

      xor  rax, rax
      leave
      ret

how do we determine the precsision, now we get 1.5000000
what is p.133 all about? movups and ...

According to the x86 ABI, EBX, ESI, EDI, and EBP are callee-save registers and EAX, ECX and EDX are caller-save registers.
this means library functions may destroy eax, ecx and edx so the call has to save them
The other ones are not touched unless the programmer writes a function which does that
they dont have to be saved
read through the SYS V ABI x64

add some flexibility to the program 
n = scanf("%ld, %hd"); return value 2 if sucessfull
what's interesting is that it returns 2 even when more than 2 parameters are given

check that the division is done properly, what quotent and remainder registers should we use
ax (16) <- +8 ah (8) <- +8 al (0)
clear rdx register if needed, may cause a float exception

times directive is causing problems
if kWh_array: resw nr_of_samples is replaced by kWh_array: times 3 resw 1 or kWh_array: times 3 dw 0
the first element becomes 1280 instead of 1500 in the second loop
elements are inserted in the following order: 1500, 2000, 2500
the 2 last elements remain the same but the first one changes?
times has cause problems earlier, check this out!

the difference between felf, elf and hex file?

what value is the segment egister ds holding?

are the addresses of the segment addresses put into segment registers when the library is loaded

Apart from the DS, CS and SS registers, there are other extra segment registers - ES (extra segment), FS and GS, which provide additional segments for storing data.

In assembly programming, a program needs to access the memory locations. All memory locations within a segment are relative to the starting address of the segment. A segment begins in an address evenly divisible by 16 or hexadecimal 10. So, the rightmost hex digit in all such memory addresses is 0, which is not generally stored in the segment registers.

The segment registers stores the starting addresses of a segment. To get the exact location of data or instruction within a segment, an offset value (or displacement) is required. To reference any memory location in a segment, the processor combines the segment address in the segment register with the offset value of the location.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38277327/assembly-segment-register-offset-register
ds holds the number of the block which is multiplied with 16 (10h) afterwich the offset is added (+) to the register to get the address of the desired
data item
