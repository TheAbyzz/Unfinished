;
; Write an assembly program to read two 8 byte integers with scanf
; and compute their greatest common divisor using Euclid's algoÂ­rithm, 
; which is based on the recursive definition
;
;              
; gcd(a,b,"c") = { a              if b = 0   
;            { gcd(b,a mod b,"c") otherwise
;
; The c parameter is not relevant, I added it only to make backtracing a bit more interesting. It's incremented
; every time gcd is called, saved on the stack in the stack frame and passed to the callee (gcd). After the caller's 
; base pointer is saved and a new baser pointer is created, local variables, registers and parameters are saved the stack 
; before the next function is called. In Linux the registers: rdi , rsi, rdx, rex, r8 and r9 are used for parameter 
; passing but additional parameters and parameters which do not fit in the registers are saved on the stack. Parameters 
; are accessed by positive offsets of rbp and local variables by negative offsets of rbp. Parameters and local variables 
; are sometimes accessed by offsets rsp. Remember the 16 byte stack aligmnent requirement!
